    "enunciado": "Given a string \ns\n and an integer \nk\n, partition \ns\n into \nk\n \nsubstrings\n such that the letter changes needed to make each substring a \nsemi-palindrome\n are minimized.\n\n\nReturn the \nminimum\n number of letter changes\n required\n.\n\n\nA \nsemi-palindrome\n is a special type of string that can be divided into \npalindromes\n based on a repeating pattern. To check if a string is a semi-palindrome:​\n\n\n\n\nChoose a positive divisor \nd\n of the string's length. \nd\n can range from \n1\n up to, but not including, the string's length. For a string of length \n1\n, it does not have a valid divisor as per this definition, since the only divisor is its length, which is not allowed.\n\n\nFor a given divisor \nd\n, divide the string into groups where each group contains characters from the string that follow a repeating pattern of length \nd\n. Specifically, the first group consists of characters at positions \n1\n, \n1 + d\n, \n1 + 2d\n, and so on; the second group includes characters at positions \n2\n, \n2 + d\n, \n2 + 2d\n, etc.\n\n\nThe string is considered a semi-palindrome if each of these groups forms a palindrome.\n\n\n\n\nConsider the string \n\"abcabc\"\n:\n\n\n\n\nThe length of \n\"abcabc\"\n is \n6\n. Valid divisors are \n1\n, \n2\n, and \n3\n.\n\n\nFor \nd = 1\n: The entire string \n\"abcabc\"\n forms one group. Not a palindrome.\n\n\nFor \nd = 2\n:\n\t\n\n\nGroup 1 (positions \n1, 3, 5\n): \n\"acb\"\n\n\nGroup 2 (positions \n2, 4, 6\n): \n\"bac\"\n\n\nNeither group forms a palindrome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor \nd = 3\n:\n\t\n\n\nGroup 1 (positions \n1, 4\n): \n\"aa\"\n\n\nGroup 2 (positions \n2, 5\n): \n\"bb\"\n\n\nGroup 3 (positions \n3, 6\n): \n\"cc\"\n\n\nAll groups form palindromes.

Change \n\"ab\"\n to \n\"aa\"\n, it becomes semi-palindrome with \nd = 1\n.\n\n\n\n\nExample 2: \n\n\n\n\nInput: \n \n s = \"abcdef\", k = 2 \n\n\nOutput: \n \n 2 \n\n\nExplanation: \n Divide \ns\n into substrings \n\"abc\"\n and \n\"def\"\n.

    "enunciado": "Alice and Bob want to water \nn\n plants in their garden. The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from \n0\n to \nn - 1\n from left to right where the \ni\nth\n plant is located at \nx = i\n.\n\n\nEach plant needs a specific amount of water. Alice and Bob have a watering can each, \ninitially full\n. They water the plants in the following way:\n\n\n\n\nAlice waters the plants in order from \nleft to right\n, starting from the \n0\nth\n plant. Bob waters the plants in order from \nright to left\n, starting from the \n(n - 1)\nth\n plant. They begin watering the plants \nsimultaneously\n.\n\n\nIt takes the same amount of time to water each plant regardless of how much water it needs.\n\n\nAlice/Bob \nmust\n water the plant if they have enough in their can to \nfully\n water it. Otherwise, they \nfirst\n refill their can (instantaneously) then water the plant.\n\n\nIn case both Alice and Bob reach the same plant, the one with \nmore\n water currently in his/her watering can should water this plant. If they have the same amount of water, then Alice should water this plant.\n\n\n\n\nGiven a \n0-indexed\n integer array \nplants\n of \nn\n integers, where \nplants[i]\n is the amount of water the \ni\nth\n plant needs, and two integers \ncapacityA\n and \ncapacityB\n representing the capacities of Alice's and Bob's watering cans respectively, return \nthe \nnumber of times\n they have to refill to water all the plants\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 1:\n\n\n\n\nInput:\n plants = [2,2,3,3], capacityA = 5, capacityB = 5\n\nOutput:\n 1\n\nExplanation:\n\n- Initially, Alice and Bob have 5 units of water each in their watering cans.\n- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3.\n- Alice and Bob now have 3 units and 2 units of water respectively.\n- Alice has enough water for plant 1, so she waters it. Bob does not have enough water for plant 2, so he refills his can then waters it.\nSo, the total number of times they have to refill to water all the plants is 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\n\n\nInput:\n plants = [2,2,3,3], capacityA = 3, capacityB = 4\n\nOutput:\n 2\n\nExplanation:\n\n- Initially, Alice and Bob have 3 units and 4 units of water in their watering cans respectively.\n- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3.\n- Alice and Bob now have 1 unit of water each, and need to water plants 1 and 2 respectively.\n- Since neither of them have enough water for their current plants, they refill their cans and then water the plants.\nSo, the total number of times they have to refill to water all the plants is 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.\n\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\n\n\nInput:\n plants = [5], capacityA = 10, capacityB = 8\n\nOutput:\n 0\n\nExplanation:\n\n- There is only one plant.\n- Alice's watering can has 10 units of water, whereas Bob's can has 8 units. Since Alice has more water in her can, she waters this plant.\nSo, the total number of times they have to refill is 0.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nConstraints:\n\n\n\n\nn == plants.length\n\n\n1 <= n <= 10\n5\n\n\n1 <= plants[i] <= 10\n6\n\n\nmax(plants[i]) <= capacityA, capacityB <= 10\n9",

Every \nn\nth\n customer paying for their groceries will be given a \npercentage discount\n. The discount amount is given by \ndiscount\n, where they will be given \ndiscount\n percent off their subtotal. More formally, if their subtotal is \nbill\n, then they would actually pay \nbill * ((100 - discount) / 100)\n.\n\n\nImplement the \nCashier\n class:\n\n\n\n\nCashier(int n, int discount, int[] products, int[] prices)\n Initializes the object with \nn\n, the \ndiscount\n, and the \nproducts\n and their \nprices\n.\n\n\ndouble getBill(int[] product, int[] amount)\n Returns the final total of the bill with the discount applied (if any).

    "enunciado": "You are given a string expression representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of.\n\n\nThe syntax for these expressions is given as follows.\n\n\n\n\nAn expression is either an integer, let expression, add expression, mult expression, or an assigned variable. Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.\n\n\n(An integer could be positive or negative.)\n\n\nA let expression takes the form \n\"(let v\n1\n e\n1\n v\n2\n e\n2\n ... v\nn\n e\nn\n expr)\"\n, where let is always the string \n\"let\"\n, then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable \nv\n1\n is assigned the value of the expression \ne\n1\n, the second variable \nv\n2\n is assigned the value of the expression \ne\n2\n, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression \nexpr\n.\n\n\nAn add expression takes the form \n\"(add e\n1\n e\n2\n)\"\n where add is always the string \n\"add\"\n, there are always two expressions \ne\n1\n, \ne\n2\n and the result is the addition of the evaluation of \ne\n1\n and the evaluation of \ne\n2\n.\n\n\nA mult expression takes the form \n\"(mult e\n1\n e\n2\n)\"\n where mult is always the string \n\"mult\"\n, there are always two expressions \ne\n1\n, \ne\n2\n and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.\n\n\nFor this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names \n\"add\"\n, \n\"let\"\n, and \n\"mult\"\n are protected and will never be used as variable names.\n\n\nFinally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on the scope.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 1:\n\n\n\n\nInput:\n expression = \"(let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))\"\n\nOutput:\n 14\n\nExplanation:\n In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,\nwe check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.\nSince x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\n\n\nInput:\n expression = \"(let x 3 x 2 x)\"\n\nOutput:\n 2\n\nExplanation:\n Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.\n\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\n\n\nInput:\n expression = \"(let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))\"\n\nOutput:\n 5\n\nExplanation:\n The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.\nThe second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nConstraints:\n\n\n\n\n1 <= expression.length <= 2000\n\n\nThere are no leading or trailing spaces in \nexpression\n.\n\n\nAll tokens are separated by a single space in \nexpression\n.\n\n\nThe answer and all intermediate calculations of that answer are guaranteed to fit in a \n32-bit\n integer.\n\n\nThe expression is guaranteed to be legal and evaluate to an integer.",

    "enunciado": "Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array of strings \nsource\n where \nsource[i]\n is the \ni\nth\n line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character \n'\\n'\n.\n\n\nIn C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.\n\n\n\n\nThe string \n\"//\"\n denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.\n\n\nThe string \n\"/*\"\n denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of \n\"*/\"\n should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string \n\"/*/\"\n does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.\n\n\n\n\nThe first effective comment takes precedence over others.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if the string \n\"//\"\n occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.\n\n\nSimilarly, if the string \n\"/*\"\n occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.\n\n\n\n\nIf a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.\n\n\nThere will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, \nsource = \"string s = \"/* Not a comment. */\";\"\n will not be a test case.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so \n\"/*\"\n outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.\n\n\nFinally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.\n\n\nAfter removing the comments from the source code, return \nthe source code in the same format\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 1:\n\n\n\n\nInput:\n source = [\"/*Test program */\", \"int main()\", \"{ \", \"  // variable declaration \", \"int a, b, c;\", \"/* This is a test\", \"   multiline  \", \"   comment for \", \"   testing */\", \"a = b + c;\", \"}\"]\n\nOutput:\n [\"int main()\",\"{ \",\"  \",\"int a, b, c;\",\"a = b + c;\",\"}\"]\n\nExplanation:\n The line by line code is visualized as below:\n/*Test program */\nint main()\n{ \n  // variable declaration \nint a, b, c;\n/* This is a test\n   multiline  \n   comment for \n   testing */\na = b + c;\n}\nThe string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string // denotes line 4 as comments.\nThe line by line output code is visualized as below:\nint main()\n{ \n  \nint a, b, c;\na = b + c;\n}\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\n\n\nInput:\n source = [\"a/*comment\", \"line\", \"more_comment*/b\"]\n\nOutput:\n [\"ab\"]\n\nExplanation:\n The original source string is \"a/*comment\\nline\\nmore_comment*/b\", where we have bolded the newline characters.

    "enunciado": "Given a string representing a code snippet, implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid.\n\n\nA code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:\n\n\n\n\nThe code must be wrapped in a \nvalid closed tag\n. Otherwise, the code is invalid.\n\n\nA \nclosed tag\n (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : \n<TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>\n. Among them, \n<TAG_NAME>\n is the start tag, and \n</TAG_NAME>\n is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is \nvalid\n if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.\n\n\nA \nvalid\n \nTAG_NAME\n only contain \nupper-case letters\n, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the \nTAG_NAME\n is \ninvalid\n.\n\n\nA \nvalid\n \nTAG_CONTENT\n may contain other \nvalid closed tags\n, \ncdata\n and any characters (see note1) \nEXCEPT\n unmatched \n<\n, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the \nTAG_CONTENT\n is \ninvalid\n.\n\n\nA start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.\n\n\nA \n<\n is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent \n>\n. And when you find a \n<\n or \n</\n, all the subsequent characters until the next \n>\n should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).\n\n\nThe cdata has the following format : \n<![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>\n. The range of \nCDATA_CONTENT\n is defined as the characters between \n<![CDATA[\n and the \nfirst subsequent\n \n]]>\n.\n\n\nCDATA_CONTENT\n may contain \nany characters\n. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse \nCDATA_CONTENT\n, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as \nregular characters\n.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 1:\n\n\n\n\nInput:\n code = \"<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>\"\n\nOutput:\n true\n\nExplanation:\n \nThe code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. \nThe TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. \nAlthough CDATA_CONTENT has an unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as a tag.\nSo TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\n\n\nInput:\n code = \"<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>\"\n\nOutput:\n true\n\nExplanation:\n\nWe first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.\nstart_tag -> \n\"<DIV>\"\n\nend_tag -> \n\"</DIV>\"\n\ntag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.\ntext1 -> \n\">>  ![cdata[]] \"\n\ncdata -> \n\"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>\"\n, where the CDATA_CONTENT is \n\"<div>]>\"\n\ntext2 -> \n\"]]>>]\"\n\nThe reason why start_tag is NOT \n\"<DIV>>>\"\n is because of the rule 6.\nThe reason why cdata is NOT \n\"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>\"\n is because of the rule 7.\n\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\n\n\nInput:\n code = \"<A>  <B> </A>   </B>\"\n\nOutput:\n false\n\nExplanation:\n Unbalanced.
