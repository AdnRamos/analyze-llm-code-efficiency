To check if a string is a semi-palindrome:​\n\n\n\n\nChoose a positive divisor \nd\n of the string's length. \nd\n can range from \n1\n up to, but not including, the string's length. For a string of length \n1\n, it does not have a valid divisor as per this definition, since the only divisor is its length, which is not allowed.\n\n\nFor a given divisor \nd\n, divide the string into groups where each group contains characters from the string that follow a repeating pattern of length \nd\n. Specifically, the first group consists of characters at positions \n1\n, \n1 + d\n, \n1 + 2d\n, and so on; the second group includes characters at positions \n2\n, \n2 + d\n, \n2 + 2d\n, etc.\n\n\nThe string is considered a semi-palindrome if each of these groups forms a palindrome.\n\n\n\n\nConsider the string \n\"abcabc\"\n:\n\n\n\n\nThe length of \n\"abcabc\"\n is \n6\n.

The positions of each factory are also \nunique\n. Note that a robot can be \nin the same position\n as a factory initially.\n\n\nAll the robots are initially broken; they keep moving in one direction. The direction could be the negative or the positive direction of the X-axis. When a robot reaches a factory that did not reach its limit, the factory repairs the robot, and it stops moving.\n\n\nAt any moment\n, you can set the initial direction of moving for \nsome\n robot.

        "enunciado": "Run-length encoding\n is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string \n\"aabccc\"\n we replace \n\"aa\"\n by \n\"a2\"\n and replace \n\"ccc\"\n by \n\"c3\"\n. Thus the compressed string becomes \n\"a2bc3\"\n.\n\n\nNotice that in this problem, we are not adding \n'1'\n after single characters.\n\n\nGiven a string \ns\n and an integer \nk\n. You need to delete \nat most\n \nk\n characters from \ns\n such that the run-length encoded version of \ns\n has minimum length.\n\n\nFind the \nminimum length of the run-length encoded version of \ns\n after deleting at most \nk\n characters\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 1:\n\n\n\n\nInput:\n s = \"aaabcccd\", k = 2\n\nOutput:\n 4\n\nExplanation: \nCompressing s without deleting anything will give us \"a3bc3d\" of length 6. Deleting any of the characters 'a' or 'c' would at most decrease the length of the compressed string to 5, for instance delete 2 'a' then we will have s = \"abcccd\" which compressed is abc3d. Therefore, the optimal way is to delete 'b' and 'd', then the compressed version of s will be \"a3c3\" of length 4.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\n\n\nInput:\n s = \"aabbaa\", k = 2\n\nOutput:\n 2\n\nExplanation: \nIf we delete both 'b' characters, the resulting compressed string would be \"a4\" of length 2.\n\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\n\n\nInput:\n s = \"aaaaaaaaaaa\", k = 0\n\nOutput:\n 3\n\nExplanation: \nSince k is zero, we cannot delete anything. The compressed string is \"a11\" of length 3.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nConstraints:\n\n\n\n\n1 <= s.length <= 100\n\n\n0 <= k <= s.length\n\n\ns\n contains only lowercase English letters.",

Now the score of Bob is 7 and Bob wins.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\n\n\nInput:\n stoneValue = [1,2,3,-9]\n\nOutput:\n \"Alice\"\n\nExplanation:\n Alice must choose all the three piles at the first move to win and leave Bob with negative score.\nIf Alice chooses one pile her score will be 1 and the next move Bob's score becomes 5. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and lose.\nIf Alice chooses two piles her score will be 3 and the next move Bob's score becomes 3. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and also lose.\nRemember that both play optimally so here Alice will choose the scenario that makes her win.\n\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\n\n\nInput:\n stoneValue = [1,2,3,6]\n\nOutput:\n \"Tie\"\n\nExplanation:\n Alice cannot win this game. She can end the game in a draw if she decided to choose all the first three piles, otherwise she will lose.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nConstraints:\n\n\n\n\n1 <= stoneValue.length <= 5 * 10\n4\n\n\n-1000 <= stoneValue[i] <= 1000",

This means a string could have multiple possible strings it can decrypt to.\n\n\nReplace \ns\n with \nkeys[i]\n in the string.\n\n\n\n\nImplement the \nEncrypter\n class:\n\n\n\n\nEncrypter(char[] keys, String[] values, String[] dictionary)\n Initializes the \nEncrypter\n class with \nkeys, values\n, and \ndictionary\n.\n\n\nString encrypt(String word1)\n Encrypts \nword1\n with the encryption process described above and returns the encrypted string.\n\n\nint decrypt(String word2)\n Returns the number of possible strings \nword2\n could decrypt to that also appear in \ndictionary\n.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 1:\n\n\n\n\nInput\n\n[\"Encrypter\", \"encrypt\", \"decrypt\"]\n[[['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], [\"ei\", \"zf\", \"ei\", \"am\"], [\"abcd\", \"acbd\", \"adbc\", \"badc\", \"dacb\", \"cadb\", \"cbda\", \"abad\"]], [\"abcd\"], [\"eizfeiam\"]]\n\nOutput\n\n[null, \"eizfeiam\", 2]\n\n\nExplanation\n\nEncrypter encrypter = new Encrypter([['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], [\"ei\", \"zf\", \"ei\", \"am\"], [\"abcd\", \"acbd\", \"adbc\", \"badc\", \"dacb\", \"cadb\", \"cbda\", \"abad\"]);\nencrypter.encrypt(\"abcd\"); // return \"eizfeiam\". \n                           // 'a' maps to \"ei\", 'b' maps to \"zf\", 'c' maps to \"ei\", and 'd' maps to \"am\".\nencrypter.decrypt(\"eizfeiam\"); // return 2. \n                              // \"ei\" can map to 'a' or 'c', \"zf\" maps to 'b', and \"am\" maps to 'd'. \n                              // Thus, the possible strings after decryption are \"abad\", \"cbad\", \"abcd\", and \"cbcd\". \n                              // 2 of those strings, \"abad\" and \"abcd\", appear in dictionary, so the answer is 2.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nConstraints:\n\n\n\n\n1 <= keys.length == values.length <= 26\n\n\nvalues[i].length == 2\n\n\n1 <= dictionary.length <= 100\n\n\n1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 100\n\n\nAll \nkeys[i]\n and \ndictionary[i]\n are \nunique\n.\n\n\n1 <= word1.length <= 2000\n\n\n2 <= word2.length <= 200\n\n\nAll \nword1[i]\n appear in \nkeys\n.\n\n\nword2.length\n is even.\n\n\nkeys\n, \nvalues[i]\n, \ndictionary[i]\n, \nword1\n, and \nword2\n only contain lowercase English letters.\n\n\nAt most \n200\n calls will be made to \nencrypt\n and \ndecrypt\n \nin total\n.",

You will get:\n\n\n\n\n\"Either you took too many guesses, or you did not find the secret word.\"\n if you called \nMaster.guess\n more than \nallowedGuesses\n times or if you did not call \nMaster.guess\n with the secret word, or\n\n\n\"You guessed the secret word correctly.\"\n if you called \nMaster.guess\n with the secret word with the number of calls to \nMaster.guess\n less than or equal to \nallowedGuesses\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe test cases are generated such that you can guess the secret word with a reasonable strategy (other than using the bruteforce method).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 1:\n\n\n\n\nInput:\n secret = \"acckzz\", words = [\"acckzz\",\"ccbazz\",\"eiowzz\",\"abcczz\"], allowedGuesses = 10\n\nOutput:\n You guessed the secret word correctly.\n\nExplanation:\n\nmaster.guess(\"aaaaaa\") returns -1, because \"aaaaaa\" is not in wordlist.\nmaster.guess(\"acckzz\") returns 6, because \"acckzz\" is secret and has all 6 matches.\nmaster.guess(\"ccbazz\") returns 3, because \"ccbazz\" has 3 matches.\nmaster.guess(\"eiowzz\") returns 2, because \"eiowzz\" has 2 matches.\nmaster.guess(\"abcczz\") returns 4, because \"abcczz\" has 4 matches.\nWe made 5 calls to master.guess, and one of them was the secret, so we pass the test case.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\n\n\nInput:\n secret = \"hamada\", words = [\"hamada\",\"khaled\"], allowedGuesses = 10\n\nOutput:\n You guessed the secret word correctly.\n\nExplanation:\n Since there are two words, you can guess both.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nConstraints:\n\n\n\n\n1 <= words.length <= 100\n\n\nwords[i].length == 6\n\n\nwords[i]\n consist of lowercase English letters.\n\n\nAll the strings of \nwordlist\n are \nunique\n.\n\n\nsecret\n exists in \nwords\n.\n\n\n10 <= allowedGuesses <= 30",

Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.\n\n\n(An integer could be positive or negative.)\n\n\nA let expression takes the form \n\"(let v\n1\n e\n1\n v\n2\n e\n2\n ... v\nn\n e\nn\n expr)\"\n, where let is always the string \n\"let\"\n, then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable \nv\n1\n is assigned the value of the expression \ne\n1\n, the second variable \nv\n2\n is assigned the value of the expression \ne\n2\n, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression \nexpr\n.\n\n\nAn add expression takes the form \n\"(add e\n1\n e\n2\n)\"\n where add is always the string \n\"add\"\n, there are always two expressions \ne\n1\n, \ne\n2\n and the result is the addition of the evaluation of \ne\n1\n and the evaluation of \ne\n2\n.\n\n\nA mult expression takes the form \n\"(mult e\n1\n e\n2\n)\"\n where mult is always the string \n\"mult\"\n, there are always two expressions \ne\n1\n, \ne\n2\n and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.\n\n\nFor this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names \n\"add\"\n, \n\"let\"\n, and \n\"mult\"\n are protected and will never be used as variable names.\n\n\nFinally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially.
